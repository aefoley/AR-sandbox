              <p>Our commitment to long-term sustainability drives us to build shareholder and customer value in new and exciting ways while still fulfilling our fundamental responsibility to provide safe, reliable energy every hour of every day to everyone. </p>
              <p></p> In 2018, we made significant new investments in clean energy generation.We partnered with stakeholders to grow the use of electric vehicles. And, we  worked with customers and communities to build a better, smarter energy future for all of us.</p> 
              <h4 class="subtitle">Consistent financial performance</h4>
              <p>MGE Energy has increased the dividend for 43 consecutive years and paid dividends for more than 100 years. No other Wisconsin utility or utility holding company can match our  history of dividend increases. The financial publisher Mergent  consistently recognizes MGE Energy as a “Dividend Achiever”  for our dividend performance. </p>
              <p>In 2018, your Board of Directors increased the annual  dividends paid by 4.8% to $1.32 per share. In total, over the  last five years, shareholders have seen 23% dividend growth.</p>
              <p>Total return is another indicator of your investment’s  performance. It is the combination of stock price and  reinvested dividends. Throughout the last five years,  MGE Energy’s annualized total return was nearly 12%—outperforming the Russell 2000, S&P 500 and EEI Investor-  Owned Electric Utilities. A $1,000 investment in MGE Energy,  with dividends reinvested, would have grown to $1,756 during  the five years ending Dec. 31, 2018. </p>
              <p>We reported earnings of $2.43 per share in 2018 compared to  $2.82 per share in 2017, which includes a 62-cent per share  one-time, non-cash tax benefit due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs  Act. Strong earnings in 2018 resulted from higher gas and  electric retail sales due to weather conditions and customer growth.</p>
              <p>MGE Energy continues to earn recognition nationwide for our  disciplined approach to financial management. MGE maintains  the highest credit ratings of any investor-owned combination  utility in the nation from both Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and  Moody’s. Value Line also gives MGE Energy top marks for  investment safety and its highest grades for financial strength.</p>
              <h4 class="subtitle">Growth for a cleaner, connected future  </h4>
              <p>MGE Energy is growing our asset base by investing in  new, clean energy generation as well as the systems and  capabilities to deliver new programs, products and services to our customers. These investments will enable MGE to serve  as your community energy company for the future.</p>
              <p>Our $212 million in capital investment in 2018 was driven by  the construction of our $112 million Saratoga Wind Farm in  northeast Iowa and investments in new systems for enterprise  resource planning, work and asset management, and  human capital management. Known as Enterprise Forward,  this multiyear initiative will replace legacy software with  new integrated, digital technology. In 2019, we project an  estimated $145 million in capital expenditures, which include  spending to enhance the customer experience and to enable  MGE to meet customers’ changing needs and expectations  more efficiently and effectively.</p>
              <p>MGE Energy is making these new investments while  managing costs to customers. A rate case settlement  agreement with intervenors lowers electric rates in 2019 and  raises natural gas rates slightly in 2019 and 2020. These rate  changes reflect the tax-savings impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts  and Jobs Act and the addition of cost-effective renewable.</p>
